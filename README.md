Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

📚 Overview
This project applies linear regression to predict house prices based on features such as area and number of bedrooms. The goal is to build a simple linear regression model, evaluate it using common metrics (MAE, MSE, R²), and interpret the coefficients. The dataset used includes various features that affect house prices.

📋 What I Did
- Loaded and preprocessed the house price dataset.
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Built and trained a linear regression model using `sklearn.linear_model`.
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
  - R-squared (R²): Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- Interpreted the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on house price prediction.
